The data preprocessing stage included cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors, dealing with missing data using imputation, and handling outliers that might skew the results through the "capping" method. Furthermore, temporal and seasonal parameters were developed to capture the time-dependent patterns in the data, and weather-related features were retrieved to incorporate climatic impacts on energy demand. Moreover, trends and seasonality were removed from the target variable in order to effectively isolate the underlying patterns. Categorical variables were encoded to incorporate them in machine learning models, and the data were resampled at an hourly frequency for consistency and ease of analysis. To carry out these preparation steps, several Python tools were used, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Scikit-Learn for categorical variable encoding. Additionally, the Statsmodels library was used for seasonal decomposition analysis to identify seasonal components in the data.
